# Python-Foundationals 1
To build a strong grounding in molecular biology, programming, and essential bioinformatics tools. Mostly a refresher.

The aim of this foundational workspace is:
- To have a place in which I note useful Python commands and describe computational terms.
- To recap and master python fundamental libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
- Create an overview of the drug discovery pipeline.
- List, link and define the major bioinformatics databases.
- Sequence retrieval via APIs and web interfaces.

I will work on these in the month of November and have a play with some data. Should be pretty easy since I've already worked on these skills/tools in the past, just want to have something down for future reference.
